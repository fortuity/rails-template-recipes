h1. UPDATE

This project is no longer active or useful. It was developed for an older version of "RailsWizard":http://railswizard.org/.

Use the "rails3_devise_wizard":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3_devise_wizard instead.

h1. Rails-Template-Recipes

This is a collection of Ruby scripts ("recipes") used to create custom application templates.

h4. Build Custom Application Templates

Application templates are often used to generate a Rails 3 "starter" or "skeleton" app that can be the basis for many projects.

Here's an example of an application template for a starter app that was assembled from these recipes:

* "rails3-mongoid-devise application template":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates/blob/master/rails3-mongoid-devise-template.rb

h4. Or Use RailsWizard

"RailsWizard":http://railswizard.org/ is a website you can visit to create application templates that are used to generate a Rails 3 web application. RailsWizard might not have all the ingredients or customizations you want for your Rails app. This is a collection of extra recipes that you can add to the RailsWizard mix.

h4. Inspired By

This project was inspired by "fnichol/rails-template-recipes":https://github.com/fnichol/rails-template-recipes.

h2. Related Projects

Here's a tutorial that shows how an example application is built from a combination of recipes:

* "Tutorial for rails3-mongoid-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/wiki/Tutorial-%28Walkthrough%29

Here are finished application templates that are assembled from recipes:

* "rails3-application-templates":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates

You can see an example application that was created from the recipes:

* "rails3-mongoid-devise":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/

h2. A Little More Explanation

Rails has a command that looks like this:

@$ rails new app_name -m /path/to/application-template.rb@

which generates a new Rails application and customizes it according to a script defined in the *application-template.rb* file.

You can create an *application-template.rb* file yourself or use one that someone else has written. Or you can visit "http://railswizard.org/":http://railswizard.org/, select various ingredients from a menu, add recipes from this repository, and programmatically generate a new application template.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating a new Rails app using an application template, you will need:

* The Ruby language (version 1.8.7 or 1.9.2)
* Rails (version 3.0.4 or newer)

bq. You MUST be using Rails 3.0.4 or newer. Generating a Rails application from an "HTTPS" URL does not work in Rails 3.0.3 and earlier versions.

I recommend installing rvm, the "Ruby Version Manager":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/, to manage multiple versions of Rails.

If you are using rvm, you can see a list of the Ruby versions currently installed:
@$ rvm list@

Check that appropriate versions of Ruby and Rails are installed in your development environment:
@$ ruby -v@
@$ rails -v@

h2. RailsWizard Usage Examples

Add the following to the *Customize Template* section at "http://railswizard.org/":http://railswizard.org/.

The array @extra_recipes@ should be a list of filenames from this repository (without the *.rb* extension).

h4. Simple Example

Using the cleanup and ban_spiders recipes as a simple example.

<pre>
  git_repo = "https://github.com/fortuity/rails-template-recipes"
  @recipe_list = recipes ; def recipe_list; @recipe_list end
  def extra_recipes; @extra_recipes end
  @extra_recipes = %w{ cleanup ban_spiders }
  @extra_recipes.each { |r| apply "#{git_repo}/raw/master/#{r}.rb" }
</pre>

h4. Rails3-Mongoid-Devise Example

Here's a complex example that generates the complete "rails3-mongoid-devise":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise example application as described in the "tutorial":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/wiki/Tutorial-%28Walkthrough%29. 

Use the RailsWizard graphical menu to select Mongoid, Haml, and a CSS framework. Do NOT select RSpec, Cucumber, jQuery, or Devise from the RailsWizard graphical menu.

<pre>
  git_repo = "https://github.com/fortuity/rails-template-recipes"
  @recipe_list = recipes ; def recipe_list; @recipe_list end
  def extra_recipes; @extra_recipes end
  @extra_recipes = %w{ git rspec cucumber jquery devise
    bson_ext mongoid_cleanup 
    action_mailer add_user_name 
    home_page home_page_users seed_database users_page 
    css_setup application_layout devise_navigation 
    cleanup ban_spiders }
  @extra_recipes.each { |r| apply "#{git_repo}/raw/master/#{r}.rb" }
</pre>

h2. How It Works

Rails generators can use any methods provided by the "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions module. The flexibility of mixing "recipes" for application templates comes from use of the @apply@ method from the Thor::Actions module. Given a web address or a local filepath, the "apply method":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions#apply-instance_method loads and executes a file within the context of the generator script.

h2. Documentation and Support

This is the only documentation.

h4. Writing Recipes

To understand the code in these templates, take a look at "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions. Your recipes can use any methods provided by "Thor::Actions":http://rdoc.info/github/wycats/thor/master/Thor/Actions or "Rails::Generators::Actions":http://railsapi.com/doc/rails-v3.0.3/classes/Rails/Generators/Actions.html.

Please send a message (via GitHub) or a "pull request" if you've written recipes you'd like to contribute.
